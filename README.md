# Health Stage

This is the place to explore the design to
[Gather and Present health-data](https://engin-boot.github.io/get-started/gather-present-fit.html)

## For Development

Decompose the functionality into modules.

This solution will keep encountering new data-sources and data-formats.
It must be possible for a team of three or more developers
to work simultaneously on new features.

Avoid getting into situations where two developers
need to change the same module -
even though they are working on different features.

## For Extended Development

Individual facilities (like hospitals) may want to add modules of their own,
to interpret and present data. 
These need to be added without needing changes in your product.
Is your solution able to do that?

## Stages

Think about the problem in stages. Each stage is in its individual folder.

Stage 0: To tackle this problem, begin with one particular use-case.

Stage 1: Add one more
